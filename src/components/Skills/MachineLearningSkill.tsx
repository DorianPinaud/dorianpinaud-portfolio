            <p>
                I'm passionate about machine learning,
                with a particular focus on images analysis.
                I have completed several MOOCs and engaged in
                independent reading to deepen my knowledge.
                My experience with PyTorch has been instrumental,
                enabling me to experiment with various models and
                techniques. Additionally, I had the opportunity to
                work on computer vision tasks in my previous role
                for DNA analysis, and thus, solidifying my skills
                and commitment to advancing in this area.
