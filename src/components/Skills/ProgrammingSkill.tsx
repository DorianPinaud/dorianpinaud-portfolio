            <p>
                I have experience working with a range of
                languages and frameworks, with strong skills
                in modern C++ and Python. I have worked
                extensively with the Qt framework and
                have experience with both relational and
                NoSQL databases. Additionally, I have modest
                experience in C#/.NET, Rust with the
                Dioxus framework, and front-end web
                development using React.</p>
