                having worked on both monolithic and microservice applications. 
                My background includes designing RESTful architectures as well 
                as event-driven systems.
                I believe in clear, well-documented architecture that brings
                teams together and reduce the technical debt. 
                I enjoy using UML to articulate complex ideas and
                make them clear to the rest of the team." icon_name="fa-solid fa-hotel" />
