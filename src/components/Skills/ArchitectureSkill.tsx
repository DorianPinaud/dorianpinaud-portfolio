            <h4>Architecture Design for Distributed Systems</h4>
            <p>
                I believe in clear, well-documented architecture that brings
                teams together and reduce the technical debt. I enjoy using UML to articulate complex ideas and
                make them clear to the rest of the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have hands-on experience with multiprocess
                architectures, message brokers, and REST API design
                for multi-node systems. Recently, I deepened my
                knowledge by exploring 'Designing Data-Intensive
                Applications' and continue to refine my skills in
                relational and document databases.
