                    Hi, I'm Dorian - Code crafter since 2016,
                    I'm a collaboratively driven developer,
                    eager to continousely learn.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>

                                I'm a team player who enjoys sharing knowledge
                                with my teammates. Communication comes naturally to me,
                                and I love attending co-working events.
                                I'm passionate about helping the team grow and evolve together
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                In my free time, I actively train myself and pursue
                                certifications to solidify my knowledge.
                                I'm curious and driven to explore various domains,
                                including problem-solving, programming languages, frameworks,
                                and machine learning. I regularly take MOOCs to stay
                                updated and am not afraid to dive into new technologies.

                                I am a well-rounded developer with experience in software
                                design and development. I have managed application costs during the design process
                                and am proficient in both Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Railway Oriented Programming (ROP). With a background in various languages and frameworks, I bring insight in both front-end and back-end development.
